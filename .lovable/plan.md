# Campaign Review - Implementation Complete

All issues from the previous plan have been resolved:

1. ✅ **launch-campaign Edge Function** - Created and deployed
2. ✅ **ManualEntryDialog** - Allows manual email/phone entry for failed enrichments
3. ✅ **StepPrepareCandidates** - Enhanced with manual entry button, source badges, improved enrichment detection
4. ✅ **LaunchStatusBar** - Now saves personalization (icebreaker, talking_points, tier, match_score) to campaign_leads_v2
5. ✅ **config.toml** - Added launch-campaign function configuration
